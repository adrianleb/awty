Evolution has blurred the lines between human and machine,

Machines have made ambiguous the lines between what is natural and what is artificial,

We are a fusion of animals and machines, we are cyborgs,

Our reality has confused the lines of physicality, we are cyborgs without a physical environment to work and create.
  
  
  
We need to reinvent ourselves:
Are we there yet?
